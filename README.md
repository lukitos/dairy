# Dairy Farm

This project is a prototype to demonstrate how a static dairy farm website can be enhanced to be a web storefront.

As a customer to the dairy farm, I noticed there are manual processes that can easily be automated.

Here's some examples:
* The farm manually send an email to the customers so they can order raw milk. There are times when the farm forgot to send the email out. Consequently, customers cannot put in their order.
* There is no easy way for customers to find the closest pick up location. They have to call the farm in order to figure out the closest location.

### About the project

How this project is built:
* Languages & frameworks: HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jquery

### Summary

This project enhances the dairy's customers experience and increases the farm's efficiency by reducing manual processes. Customers can now order raw milk at anytime without having to wait for the email to arrive. They can also use the self-serve features of the website to locate the closest pickup location.
